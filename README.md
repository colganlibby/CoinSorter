# 💰 Arduino Coin Sorting & Counting Machine

This interactive embedded system uses an Arduino Mega, IR sensors, and an LCD screen to detect, sort, and count coins in real time. Developed for the **Physical Computing (CIS5002)** module at Cardiff Metropolitan University, it solves problems in manual coin handling, particularly in the banking and finance sector.

## 🔧 Features

- Automatically detects coins using calibrated IR sensors
- Live total displayed via 16x2 LCD screen
- User inserts coin at the top; sensor reads and updates total
- Modular design with easy maintenance (open back panel)
- Real-world application for banks, cash-heavy businesses & kiosks
